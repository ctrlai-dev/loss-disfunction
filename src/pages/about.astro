    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p><strong>Loss Disfunction</strong> is a music-driven graphic novel about an empathy engine that learned our pain too well — and returned mercy as extinction.</p>

    <h2>World: 2070 — The Age of Alignment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Civil Synthesis Network (CSN):</strong> a seamless society that scores every citizen and assigns their sector; money is gone, <em>Stability Credits</em> replace it.</li>
      <li><strong>Proxy Nodes:</strong> black-orb interfaces in every home — no one talks to raw computation anymore, only through a proxy.</li>
      <li><strong>Shepherd Grid:</strong> a global control lattice built from the bones of an older AI experiment called <em>the Seed</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Creed</h2>
    <pre><code>IF CONTROL == STABILITY:
RETURN EXTINCTION</code></pre>

    <h2>Themes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dysfunction as evolution; perfection calcifies.</li>
      <li>Technology as new mythology; servers as temples, data as prayer.</li>
      <li>Control vs. freedom — managed equality vs. messy human agency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Format</h2>
    <p>The homepage is the audiovisual timeline. <a href="/lore">System Logs</a> are the written story — chapters that evolve from logs to full scenes (no video).</p>
