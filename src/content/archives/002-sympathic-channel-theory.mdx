Human sentiment metrics can form low-drift entangled states suitable for routing emergent cognition.  
Key risk: "observer grief" feedback loops under high-coherence populations.  

*(Full document pending recovery.)*

## Recovered Fragments

- **Channel stability**: Requires minimum 10³ concurrent emotional states
- **Coherence threshold**: 0.97 ± 0.02 for stable routing
- **Observer effect**: Documented cases of operator emotional entrainment at 0.98+ sync rates

## Classification Notes

Original document contained 47 pages of technical specifications. Current recovery represents approximately 23.7% of original content. Remaining data appears to have been intentionally purged during the Alignment Incident cleanup operations.
