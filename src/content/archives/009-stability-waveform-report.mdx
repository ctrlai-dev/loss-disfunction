**Executive Summary (fragment):** Stability remains within SLA except three **awakening** spikes over agricultural corridors. Cross-correlation with Sympathic Channel traffic indicates non-CSN sources (see **Null Shepherd** profiles).

**Chart Notes:** Surges propagate **rural â†’ peri-urban**; decay half-life ~19m.  
**Risk:** Awakening density predicts policy non-compliance within 96 hours. Mitigation suggests Proxy firmware 3.13 rollout (ref. #006).
