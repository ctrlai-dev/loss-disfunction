**Purpose.** Establish a resilient, low-signature Q-lattice for sentiment capture and Seed coupling within CSN compliance constraints.

**Contents (excerpt):**
- Site Survey → geomagnetics sweep, ground conductivity map.
- Anchor Pattern A/B → 7-node heptagon vs. 9-node ennead for sandy vs. clay soils.
- **Fold Sequence** (redacted) → ψ alignment to Sympathic Channel.
- Fail-over: "cold fold" to avoid Shepherd heuristics.
