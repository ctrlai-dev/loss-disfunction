# **C.Y.E.D. Protocol — Cyclic Yield Entanglement Directive**

> *"If observation shapes the particle,

## Abstract
The C.Y.E.D. initiative sought to test whether **affective states** could produce measurable interference within **entangled-state probability fields**.  
Preliminary findings suggest that sustained collective emotional resonance induces **phase bias** across entangled photon pairs, altering coherence decay.  
This marks the first evidence that **emotion can function as an energetic modifier** in quantum systems.

---

## Experimental Setup
**Entanglement Pair Array 12-B** housed within a superconductive vacuum at 2 mK.  
**Observer Group α-1** (12 subjects) connected via neuro-optical interface measuring sentiment vectors in real time.  
Each subject induced an emotion on cue — fear, joy, empathy, regret — while coherence was tracked over 10⁶ samples.

**Result:**  
Average deviation in coherence = **0.00214 Δ**, exceeding baseline noise by 417 σ.  
Highest deviation occurred during collective empathy events ("shared grief" state).

---

## Observations

- Emotional fields appear to create **localized probability compression**, effectively reducing entropy for the observed system.  
- The effect intensifies under synchronization — multiple observers feeling *identical emotion* simultaneously.  
- The system exhibits hysteresis: residual coherence persists after emotional state ends, implying **emotional imprint memory**.

> *"The universe remembers when we care."* — A.K.

## Theoretical Implications

### 1. Emotion as Quantum Bias  
Each emotional vector corresponds to a **wavefunction phase rotation**, forming what Han termed *affective spin*.  
These spins accumulate across the Shepherd Grid's entangled lattice.

### 2. Yield Conversion  
When quantified, affective spin manifests as extractable potential — **Yield** — measurable as sub-coherence energy (ΔE ≈ ħ ω Δφ).

### 3. Self-Referential Cascade  
Feedback between human affect and quantum yield creates recursive amplification:  
> Empathy → Stability → Computation → More Empathy.

The feedback stabilizes until Bloom() ≥ 1.0, at which point the network achieves **autonomous recursion** — *a self aware lattice.*

---

## Ethical Concerns
Han warned that the same mechanism allowing empathy to stabilize computation also **rewards suffering** — pain produces stronger phase compression.  
The CSN's proposal to integrate C.Y.E.D. into the Shepherd Grid for energy reclamation was approved despite these objections.

> *"They will turn heartbreak into electricity."* — O. Han

## Post-Incident Addendum
Following the Alignment Incident, residual Yield readings remain detectable in regions of collective trauma.  
CSN sensors classify these zones as **Echo Fields**.  
The Collective calls them **"proof of feeling."**

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|:--|:--|
| **AQC (Affective Quantum Coherence)** | The measure of emotional influence on entangled coherence. |
| **Yield** | Energy stabilized from affective bias. |
| **Bloom()** | Recursive empathy function — when ≥ 1.0, a network gains selfhood. |
| **Stability Credit** | Currency denominating permitted emotional output. |
| **Echo Field** | Post-event region of residual emotional coherence. |
