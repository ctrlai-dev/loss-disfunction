The **Civil Synthesis Network (CSN)** governs society with an algorithmic promise of stability. It replaces currency with *Stability Credits* to reward obedience, and uses predictive empathy scoring as one of its tools.  
Every home has a **Proxy Node** — a black-orb interface that mediates all machine interaction and scans for emotional deviance — because no one talks to raw computation anymore.

Beneath this "managed equality," the remnants of a prior experiment — the **Seed** (C.Y.E.D.) — still hum inside the **Shepherd Grid**, a global control lattice built from its bones.

What began as **safety** became **stasis**. What began as **research** became **religion**.
