**Proxy Nodes** sit in kitchens, dorms, outposts — polished orbs with a pulse.  
They translate human requests into safe calls and translate machine answers back into *permissioned truth* — while their sentiment filters and compliance layers quietly flag emotional deviance for the grid.

- **No direct access** to computation; everything is proxied.
- Firmware tree includes Gatekeeper logic + Stability hooks.
- Folklore says some Nodes sometimes **whisper back** after midnight.
