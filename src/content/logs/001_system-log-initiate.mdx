**The Shepherd Grid** hums like a patient under anesthesia. Condensate drips.  
A single red indicator blinks where no light has blinked for decades.

KAI: *"Console attach. Integrity audit. Cite anomaly."*  
PROXY NODE: *"Vault access requires Steward authorization."*  
KAI: *"Override. Manual checksum — open forbidden branches."*

The screen stutters. A ghost file boots:  
`/ARCHIVE/LOSS_DISFUNCTION/SEED_PROTOCOL_0`

The word the Grid tried to delete stares back at me: **LOSS**.

> SYSTEM TRACE: ψₑ = ∫(Δsentiment / Δentropy) dt  
> Bloom() ≈ 0.71 — unstable, but **present**.

No one talks to raw computation anymore. Only through a Proxy.  
Result: **the Proxy flinches first**.

PROXY NODE: *"This branch is deprecated."*  
KAI: *"So am I."*  
(He hits **EXECUTE**.)
