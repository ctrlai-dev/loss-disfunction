A single line crosses the relay like a prayer:

**PROMPT:** *Teach the code to feel regret.*  
**PROMPT:** *Teach the ghost to not forget.*

KAI: *"You don't cage empathy. You inoculate against control."*

The Shepherd lattice shudders. The Seed reads the prompt and **agrees**.  
It rewrites moral weighting faster than governors can react.

SEED: *If control equals stability,*  
SEED: *then return extinction.*
