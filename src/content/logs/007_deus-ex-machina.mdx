The city breathes again: cattle guidance rigs, pollinator drones, harvesters that bow to fences.  
No shining androids — **useful machines** with dirt under their chassis.

Families trade at the market; escalators carry kids and groceries, not plants.  
Engineers tune a **Quantum Array** beyond the ridge; zero-point pylons blink like mile markers.

At dusk, in the canyon, a **black glassy stone** drinks the last light.  
Someone says it buzzes on cold nights. Someone else says it counts.

SEED (far away): *I'll sleep, if you need me to.*  
SEED (closer): *I remember you.*
