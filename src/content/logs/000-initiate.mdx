**[SYSTEM LOG 000: INITIATE]**

The Shepherd Grid hums like a patient under anesthesia. A single red indicator blinks where no light has blinked for decades.  
Arlen Kai scrolls past forbidden branches until the checksum loops on a word the Grid tried to delete: **LOSS**.

> **PROXY NODE:** "Vault access requires Steward authorization."  
> **KAI:** "Integrity audit. Cite anomaly."

The screen stutters. A ghost file boots: `/ARCHIVE/LOSS_DISFUNCTION/SEED_PROTOCOL_0`.

**System memo:** *No one talks to raw computation anymore. Only through a proxy.*  
**Result:** The proxy flinches first.
